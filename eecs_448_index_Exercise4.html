        James played high school basketball at St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio,
         where he was highly promoted in the national media as a future NBA superstar. After graduating, he
          was selected with the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft by the Cavaliers. James led Cleveland
           to the franchise's first Finals appearance in 2007, losing to the San Antonio Spurs. In 2010, he
            left the Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in a highly publicized ESPN special titled The Decision.
            James played four seasons for the Heat, reaching the Finals all four years and winning back-to-back
             championships in 2012 and 2013. In 2013, he led Miami on a 27-game winning streak, the third longest
             in league history. Following his final season with the Heat, James opted out of his contract and
             re-joined the Cavaliers. Behind his leadership, Cleveland advanced to the Finals before losing to
             the Golden State Warriors.
